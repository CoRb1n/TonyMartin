							<h2 class="text-lg title-font font-medium mb-3">Fixed Fees</h2>
							<p class="leading-relaxed text-base">
								Once we have completed a free consultation with you, I will then
								advise you how best to handle your matter and the cost involved.
								The costs provided will be fixed, which means it will not cost
								you anymore than the amount quoted. A Fixed Fee arrangement is
								better for all parties as it will give you peace of mind as to
								your budget and it will avoid any financial issues for you down
								the track.
							</p>

							<p class="leading-relaxed text-base">
								At Thexton Lawyers, we will enter into a fixed fee agreement

								you as a quote.

							<p class="leading-relaxed text-base">
								Once you make contact with us, I will send you a family law
								template questionnaire to complete and return to me. This will
								enable me to prepare for your free consultation.
							</p>

							<p class="leading-relaxed text-base">
								What I offer is a free consultation (which can be done by
								phone), in which during this consultation, I will be able to
								advise you on how best to run your matter to achieve the best
								possible outcome for you, the costs associated with engaging a
								lawyer to assist you, the likely time-frame to finalize your
								matter bearing in mind the emotional and financial costs
								involved and most importantly the likely outcome. I will also
								advise you on how best to minimize your costs when separation
								does take place.
							</p>

							<p class="leading-relaxed text-base">
								If your matter requires further work beyond the free
								consultation, then I will advise you on the work required and
								the cost, which will be fixed.
